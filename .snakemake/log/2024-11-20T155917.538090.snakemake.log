MissingOutputException in rule create_graphs in file /Users/ryansponzilli/Developer/UIUC/is477/ryan-ben-vital/Snakefile, line 31:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/heatmap.pngresults/lineplot.pngresults/lmplot.pngresults/pairplot.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
