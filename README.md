## Summary
The overall goal of this project is to explore a correlation phenomenon between the number of car accidents and amount of precipitation per month within Iowa, using data from a 2009-2024 timeframe. We combined data from these two domains to successfully communicate our findings through intuitive visualizations and a linear regression model. The precipitation data was drawn from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), whilst the car accident data was made available by Iowaâ€™s Open Data Platform. The precipitation data and car accident metrics were integrated together for analysis. After data profiling, quality assessment, and cleaning, we moved on to exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and modeling. The people who would benefit from this analysis are urban planners, emergency response services, and climate change researchers. Potential societal impacts of this analysis are more general awareness of the need for safe driving practices, especially during increased precipitation.

Imported data is from time range year 1895 to 2024. Dataset includes columns: `Date`, `Value`, `Anomaly`. Column `Date` contains the date of record in the format *YYYYMM*. Column `Value` contains the total precipitation amount for the respective date in column `Date`. Column `Anomaly` contains the anomaly for the respective date in column `Date` and is not used in the analysis or model. The dataset was refined to years 2014 to 2024. Included below is every dataset column and respective description from the dataset website:

| Column Name | Description                                               | Data Type |

## Findings

Link to our results: [https://uofi.app.box.com/s/rhognoqb40zuhnnnxhyzgl4vb90p3rjr](https://uofi.app.box.com/s/rhognoqb40zuhnnnxhyzgl4vb90p3rjr)

After wrangling our data together from our two sources into a single csv file, we began with some exploratory data analysis. Our results consist of four different data visualizations and one linear regression equation. The first visualization is a pair plot that shows `precipitation` plotted against the other nine variables. From these plots we can see that precipitation exhibits a strong positive relationship with `count`, `possinjury`, `mininjury`, and `propdmg`, a weak positive relationship with `uninjury`, `majinjury`, and `fatalities`, and a strong negative relationship with `year`. This suggests that more precipitation results in more minor car accidents than more major car accidents. The second visualization is a heatmap and we have highlighted the row/column of the `precipitation` variable to draw attention to it. This heatmap essentially depicts the same observations that we saw in the pair plot, but in the form of correlation coefficients. The third visualization is a line plot with `count` (number of accidents), and `precipitation` overlayed on the same graph. In this graph we can see that prior to 2017 the two factors don't trend together, but after 2017 they both trend downward together. The fourth visualization is a linear model plot (lmplot). In this visualization look again at the strong positive relationship between `count` and `precipitation`. There is one major outlier, but the rest of the data points are fairly tight to the line of best fit. The other result that we produced is the following linear regression equation: $\widehat{count} = 196.37210083007812 \cdot precipitation + 1943.09619140625$. It shows that on average, for every additional inch of precipitation per year, we can expect 196 additional car accidents to occur. Overall, our findings indicate that a relationship does exist between precipitation and car accidents, specifically in Iowa.

## Reproducing

### Requirements
All packages, software dependencies, and the programming environment as well as their versions are specified in `doc/requirements.txt` and `doc/environment.md` and must be intalled before workflow execution.

### Code Notations
Each `.py` file in folder, `src`, has a respective `.ipynb` file in folder, `doc/code_notations`, that contains replica code and respective notations organizing and describe code processes. (`.ipynb` files are not intended to be run and are for notation purposes only.)

### Data Acquisition
The *NCEI* dataset is collected via a URL link. The *Iowa Open Data* dataset is collected via an API query. Both of these processes are included in the workflow as well as their respective integrity checks in the rule, `acquisition`.

### Running the Workflow
All code in pure python is included in the folder, `src`, as `.py` files. This is the code used to run the workflow file, `Snakefile`. The `Snakefile` creates five rules: `runall`, `acquisition`, `integration`, `analysis`, and `modeling`.

- Rule `runall` executes all processes necessary to produce `heatmap.png`, `lineplot.png`, `lmplot.png`, `pairplot.png`, and `regression-output.md`.
- Rule `acquisition` takes `src/checksums/checksums.txt` as input and, using `src/acquisition.py`, uses links and API queries to fetch and integrity check all raw datasets and saves them to `data/raw`. (The Iowa Open Data dataset is saved as three separate *.csv* files to avoid usage of GitHub Large File Storage.)
- Rule `integration` takes all raw *.csv* files as input and, using `src/integration.py`, integrates the raw datasets into the processed, final dataset, `data/processed/integrated.csv`.
- Rule `analysis` takes `data/processed/integrated.csv` as input and, using `src/analysis.py`, creates graphs and analyzes the processed dataset. Rule `modeling` takes `data/processed/integrated.csv` as input and, using `src/modeling.py`, finds the best model.

**To execute the workflow, the line:**

```
snakemake --latency-wait 300
```

**must be run in the terminal while in the `/src` directory.**
