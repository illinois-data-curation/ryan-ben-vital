MissingOutputException in rule get_data in file /Users/benleidig/Downloads/ryan-ben-vital/src/Snakefile, line 9:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../data/raw/iowa1.csv (missing locally, parent dir contents: ncei.csv)
../data/raw/iowa2.csv (missing locally, parent dir contents: ncei.csv)
../data/raw/iowa3.csv (missing locally, parent dir contents: ncei.csv)
Removing output files of failed job get_data since they might be corrupted:
../data/raw/ncei.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
