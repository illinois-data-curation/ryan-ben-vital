MissingOutputException in rule acquisition in file /Users/benleidig/Downloads/ryan-ben-vital/src/Snakefile, line 9:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 120 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../data/raw/iowa1.csv (missing locally, parent dir contents: ncei.csv)
../data/raw/iowa2.csv (missing locally, parent dir contents: ncei.csv)
../data/raw/iowa3.csv (missing locally, parent dir contents: ncei.csv)
Removing output files of failed job acquisition since they might be corrupted:
../data/raw/ncei.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
